# Zowe IntelliJ Plug-in Conformance Evaluation Criteria

The Zowe Conformance Evaluation Criteria is a set of self-certifying and self-service tests to help the development
community integrate and extend specific technology into the Zowe framework.

This document describes the requirements of the three available conformance programs. Items marked **(Req)** are
required for an application to be conformant. Items marked **(BP)** are considered best practices for
conformant applications.

Throughout this document you will find the following terminology being used:

- _Zowe IntelliJ Plug-in_: An installable piece of software that provides new functionality to IntelliJ Platform or
  uses/calls services provided by related Zowe IntelliJ Plug-ins. Also simply referred to here as an "plug-ins", this
  can be a IntelliJ Plug-in or an independent piece of software. The conformance criteria below call out conformance
  requirements for Zowe IntelliJ Plug-ins, but it is possible that more kinds of plug-ins can be created. If such new
  plug-in kinds surface, then Zowe IntelliJ Plug-ins APIs, Zowe SDKs and this document can be expanded to support them
  in the future.
- _Zowe SDKs_ are [SDKs published by the Zowe project](https://docs.zowe.org/stable/user-guide/sdks-using) that provides
  various APIs for writing Zowe-based capabilities in general.

| 1  | v1  |  x  |    |            | Plug-in must have the unique name                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                                       |
| 2  | v1  |  x  |    |            | If the plug-in uses the word "Zowe" in its name, it abides by The Linux Foundation Trademark Usage Guidelines and Branding Guidelines to ensure the word Zowe is used in a way intended by the Zowe community          | https://www.linuxfoundation.org/legal/trademark-usage |
| 3  | v1  |     | x  |            | Normally the plug-in must not depend on other Zowe-related products until the real need                                                                                                                                |                                                       |

| 6  | v1  |     | x  |            | Plug-in should support EAP IntelliJ versions when possible                                                                                                                                                             |                                                       |
| 7  | v1  |     | x  |            | Plug-in should not use internal IntelliJ API when possible                                                                                                                                                             |                                                       |
| 8  | v1  |     | x  |            | Plug-in should comply with the IntelliJ Platform UI Guidelines                                                                                                                                                         | https://jetbrains.github.io/ui/                       |
| 9  | v1  |  x  |    |            | If the plug-in accesses the same mainframe service as a Zowe CLI plug-in, the connection information should be shared via Zowe Team Config (zowe.config.json)                                                          |                                                       |
| 10 | v1  |  x  |    |            | If the plug-in uses and stores sensitive information, it must ensure the safety of such kind of information, normally - with the help of native IntelliJ Platform functions (credentials storage, virtual files, etc.) |                                                       |
| 11 | v1  |     | x  |            | It is strongly recommended to use Gradle as a build tool. This is the direct recommendation of the IntelliJ Platform                                                                                                   |                                                       |
